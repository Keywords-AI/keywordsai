### Final Diagnosis:

- Panic Disorder: The patient's symptoms of sudden episodes of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating, along with a feeling of impending doom, are indicative of Panic Disorder. This is further supported by the patient's history of anxiety and the absence of any significant cardiac findings that could explain these symptoms, as mentioned in both the Cardiologist and Psychologist's reports.

- Poorly Managed Anxiety: The patient's high-stress job, irregular exercise routine, and symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating could be related to his anxiety disorder. This is suggested by the Cardiologist's report, which also mentions the patient's family history of anxiety and the use of benzodiazepines, which can sometimes cause or exacerbate these symptoms.

- Uncontrolled GERD: The patient has been diagnosed with GERD, which can mimic symptoms of heart disease, including chest pain. This is mentioned in the Cardiologist's report and could be contributing to the patient's symptoms if not well-controlled. The Pulmonologist also suggests that severe GERD can sometimes mimic the symptoms of a heart or lung condition.
