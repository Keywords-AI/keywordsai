### Final Diagnosis:

- Panic Disorder: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating, along with a feeling of impending doom, are typical of panic attacks. Both the cardiologist and psychologist reports suggest that the patient's symptoms could be related to his anxiety disorder. The patient's family history of anxiety and personal history of anxiety disorder further support this assessment.

- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The cardiologist's report suggests that GERD could be causing some of the patient's symptoms, such as chest pain and shortness of breath. GERD is a condition in which stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus), which can irritate the lining of your esophagus and cause these symptoms.

- Potential Respiratory Issue: The pulmonologist's report suggests that the patient's symptoms could be indicative of a respiratory issue. Although the physical examination findings do not suggest a pulmonary problem, the patient's reported symptoms warrant further investigation. A pulmonary function test could help to rule out conditions such as asthma or COPD.
