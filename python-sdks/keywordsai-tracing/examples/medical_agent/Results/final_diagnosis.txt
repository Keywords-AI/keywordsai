### Final Diagnosis:

- Panic Disorder: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating, along with the fear of having a heart attack during these episodes, are indicative of panic attacks. The patient's history of anxiety and the family history of generalized anxiety disorder further support this diagnosis. (Reason: Both the cardiologist and psychologist reports suggest that the patient's symptoms could be related to his anxiety disorder, specifically panic attacks.)

- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's history of GERD could be causing or exacerbating the chest pain. GERD can sometimes mimic the symptoms of a cardiac or respiratory issue. (Reason: The cardiologist report suggests that the patient's GERD could be contributing to the chest pain, and the pulmonologist report also mentions that GERD can sometimes mimic the symptoms of a respiratory issue.)

- Potential Undiagnosed Respiratory Issue: While the physical examination and diagnostic results do not provide clear evidence of a specific respiratory condition, the patient's symptoms could potentially be indicative of an underlying respiratory issue. (Reason: The pulmonologist report suggests that the patient's symptoms could be related to a respiratory issue, despite the lack of clear evidence from the physical examination and diagnostic results.)
