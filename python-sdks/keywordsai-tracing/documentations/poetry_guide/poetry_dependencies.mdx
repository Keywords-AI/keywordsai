# Poetry Dependencies & Extras Guide

# Add dependencies to a group
poetry add pytest --group test
poetry add black flake8 --group dev

# Make a group optional
poetry group add dev --optional

# Install dependencies from a group
poetry install --group dev

# Install dependencies from multiple groups
poetry install --group test --group dev

# Install dependencies from all groups
poetry install --all-groups

# Make a group optional
In the `pyproject.toml` file, add the following:
```
[tool.poetry.group.<group_name>]
optional = true
```


## Managing Extras

### Step 1: Set Up Groups First
- Create groups for features that have dependencies
- Make the groups optional if they're for end-user features

### Step 2: Manual Extra Configuration
Add to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.extras]
# For features without dependencies
auth = []  

# For features with dependencies (must match group dependencies)
trace = ["opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis"]
```

## Installation Commands

### Development Installation
```bash
# Install all dependencies (including dev)
poetry install

# Install without dev dependencies
poetry install --without dev

# Install with specific groups
poetry install --with test,trace

# Install with extras
poetry install --extras "auth trace"
```

### End User Installation
```bash
# Core package only
pip install package-name

# With extras
pip install "package-name[auth]"
pip install "package-name[trace]"
pip install "package-name[auth,trace]"
```

## Important Notes
1. Groups are for development organization
2. Extras are for end-user feature selection
3. No direct command to create extras (manual `pyproject.toml` edit required)
4. Extras dependencies must match group dependencies when they exist
5. Core dependencies are always installed
